## Features
- Account creation (username, email, password)
- Posting (can be edited / deleted)
- Commenting (can be deleted)
- Account management (update username/email/password, delete account)
- Login session timeout after 10 minutes of inactivity
- Responsive front-end design (adapts to different viewport/screen sizes)


## Directions for future development
- The <b>email</b> feature is only nominal at this time. It should be developed to actually include account management functionality, including account verification upon signup + account recovery.
- <b>Username and password validation</b> (minimum # of characters, required uppercase/lowercase/special characters, etc.) should be added.
- All screens that require a password should have the option to <b>show or hide</b> it while inputting.
- There are places on the application where it would be helpful to have the user <b>enter their password twice</b>.
- <b>Up- or down-voting posts and comments</b>
- A <b>search</b> feature
- The option to add <b>tags</b> to posts
- <b>Sorting / filtering</b> based on date, tag, user, etc.
